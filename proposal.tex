\section{Proposal}

We wish to investigate the effect of parallel processing on sorting algorithms.  We plan to write CPU-sequential (single threaded and CPU-based), GPU-sequential, and GPU-parallel (CUDA-based) versions of the following common sorting algorithms:

\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
  \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
  \item Radix Sort
  \item Binary tree sort
  \item Heap Sort
  \item Merge Sort
  \item Quicksort
  \item Insertion Sort
  \item Bubble Sort
  \item Network Sort (parallel only)
\end{itemize}

After writing these algorithms, we plan to analyze their speed on sorting best case, worst case, and random case on two datasets, a small dataset consisting of the integers from 1 to 100k, and a large dataset consisting of the integers from 1 to 100M.  We will report the absolute speed of each algorithm (as measured using the time() function), as well as relative speedups between the sequential algorithms and the parallelized algorithm, and comment upon any interesting trends that reveal themselves.

\section{Possible Extensions}

If this is too light for the final project, we can also implement sequential and parallel versions of PageRank, or any number of other searching algorithms, and perform the same analysis as described above on a more complicated dataset (a local copy of Wikipedia, perhaps?).
